This is the initial work for an L4 based microkernel for the ARM architecture.
For now it is going to be tested under the x86 architecture.

It is prohibited to use any linux kernel header (or any header that's not included with this project) in the project's headers.

You can use any headers you want inside .c files BUT you must mark the to be removed with the following comment: /* TODO: REMOVE */ as in the following example:

/* TODO: REMOVE */
#include <stdio.h>
